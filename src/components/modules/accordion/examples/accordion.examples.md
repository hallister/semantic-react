## Accordion
Accordion is controlled component, you need to manage active values byself. 

This way you can have full control over accordion (you can have multiple active content for example) and reduces boilerplate logic from component

```require
./basic.jsx
```


### Inverted accordion

Here using strings for title keys instead numbers

```require
./styled.jsx
```

### Nested styled accordion

```require
./nested.jsx
```

for simplifity state uses simple structure, you can use nested map for value state or anything what you'd like.

### Multiple accordion

Since you're controlling values byself, you can display few secions at same time 

```require
./multiple.jsx
```

If don't need animation

```require
./do-not-animated.jsx
```
